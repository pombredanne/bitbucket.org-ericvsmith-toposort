Change log
==========

----------------------------

* When a circular dependency error is detected, raise a specific
  exception, CircularDependencyError, which is a subclass of
  ValueError.  The 'data' attribute of the exception will contain the
  data involved in the circular dependency (issue #2).  Thanks
  lilydjwg for the initial patch.

* To make building wheels easier, always require setuptools in
  setup.py (issue #5).

  and 3.x (issue #7).
